# Optimization Algorithms on the Rastrigin Function

This project implements several optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Simulated Annealing (SA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), to optimize the Rastrigin function.

## Project Structure
- `optimization_algorithms.py`: Main script for running the algorithms and visualizing the results.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains a list of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env
# Activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
# Install necessary dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Python script to see the animation and results of the optimizations:

```bash
python optimization_algorithms.py
```

## Explanation of Algorithms
This project includes implementations of the following optimization algorithms:

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** A computational method that optimizes a problem by improving candidate solutions iteratively based on given measures of quality.
- **Differential Evolution (DE):** A method that optimizes a problem by iteratively improving a candidate solution with regard to a measure of quality or objective function.
- **Simulated Annealing (SA):** A probabilistic technique that searches for an approximate solution to an optimization problem by emulating the annealing process of metals.
- **Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA):** An algorithm inspired by the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales.
- **Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA):** Inspired by the behavior of grasshoppers in nature, especially their tendency to swarm and form large groups.

## Visualization
The project visualizes the optimization paths of each algorithm over the Rastrigin function using a 3D surface plot, which is updated iteratively to show the progress of optimization.
